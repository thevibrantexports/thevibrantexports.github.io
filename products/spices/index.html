								</h4>
								<p class="card-text text-justify">Turmeric, Curcuma longa, is a robust perennial tropical herb of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) indigenous to southern Asia. In fresh state, the rootstock has an aromatic and spicy fragrance, which by drying gives way to a more medicinal aroma. On storing, the smell rather quickly changes to earthy and unpleasant. Similarly, the color of ground turmeric tends to fade if the spice is stored too long. Turmeric spice is made by grinding these orange-yellow, waxy, short rhizomes into a fine aromatic yellowish powder, which is used as a condiment and as an essential ingredient of curry powder. Turmeric is a colorful, versatile product, combining the properties of a spice and a brilliant yellow dyestuff.</p>

								</h4>
								<p class="card-text text-justify">Caraway (Carum carvi), also known as meridian fennel or Persian cumin, is a biennial plant in the family Apiaceae,native to western Asia, Europe and Northern Africa. The plant is similar in appearance to other members of the carrot family, with finely divided, feathery leaves with thread-like divisions, growing on 20–30 cm stems. The main flower stem is 40–60 cm tall, with small white or pink flowers in umbels. Caraway fruits (erroneously called seeds) are crescent-shaped achenes, around 2 mm long, with five pale ridges. The fruits, usually used whole, have a pungent, anise-like flavor and aroma that comes from essential oils, mostly carvone and limonene.[citation needed] They are used as a spice in breads, especially rye bread. Caraway is also used in desserts, liquors, casseroles, curry and other foods. It is more commonly found in European cuisine. For example, it is commonly used in British caraway seed cake and is also added to sauerkraut. It is also used to add flavor to cheeses such as bondost, pultost, nøkkelost and havarti. Akvavit and several liqueurs are made with caraway. The roots may be cooked as a root vegetable like parsnips or carrots. Caraway fruit oil is also used as a fragrance component in soaps, lotions, and perfumes.</p>
